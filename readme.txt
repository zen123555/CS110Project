Description:
This game is a 1 vs. 1 battle that is very similar to the Pokemon battle system, but much simpler. You have the option to kick, punch, heal, or block against the monster.
The game is played entirely from your IDE console. 
You will choose between three different types of monster and fighter (water, fire, and poison).
Depending on what types you choose, there will be type advantages that allow either you or the monster to inflict extra damage to each other.
